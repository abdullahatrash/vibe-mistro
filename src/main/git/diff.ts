 * a content `diffHash` (so the renderer can memoize an unchanged file and skip a

 * the renderer's memo, so it must reflect exactly the text the renderer receives. An

 *  - UNTRACKED: `git ... diff --no-color [-w] --no-index -- /dev/null <path>`. `--no-index`
 *    exits **1 when there IS a diff** (verified against real git) — so 0 AND 1 are both
 *    success (capture stdout); only a LARGER code (a real error) degrades to empty.
 * `core.quotePath=false` so non-ASCII paths come back as plain UTF-8 (matching #84's
 * status read). `ignoreWhitespace` adds `-w` (`--ignore-all-space`) — @pierre can't
 * ignore whitespace on a pre-parsed patch, so the toggle re-reads the diff here.
